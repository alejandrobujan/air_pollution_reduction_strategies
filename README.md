# Air Pollution Reduction Strategies

Air pollution refers to the unwanted mixture of foreign elements and pollutants including harmful gasses as well as particles within the air composition leading to serious harm to nature as well as living creatures. According to the World Health Organization, it is recorded that approximately 7 million deaths worldwide are caused by polluted air which correlates to many harmful diseases such as cancer and lung diseases. This clearly shows that this pollution is very concerning and we need to be catered to right away to stop it from becoming more rampant. Not paying attention to this issue will lead to further future damage to the environment and society’s state of health. It is our goal to incorporate our knowledge of machine learning to come up with an applicable model that can help decrease air pollution. Some of the questions we want to focus on during this project include what the most efficient measurements used to identify the level of polluted air are, what are the exact statistics of disease and deaths caused by air pollution as well as if there are any obvious changes in air pollution before and after the occurrence of Covid-19 pandemic, considering the extent to which human commuting affects in this issue. Finding answers to these questions will act as a solid fundamental in creating a suitable solution to this pollution issue.


## Data description

The first and second datasets revolve around the measurements of air compounds that correlate to the state of air quality specifically in the context of a geographical standpoint that focus on the different districts in the region of Seoul. The air components collected in this dataset include SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 with the measurement unit of ppm. PM10 and PM2.5 are included in the dataset with the measurement unit of microgram/m3. More concretely, the former focuses on pollution measurement by different specific streets and areas of Seoul while the latter provides us the mean annual exposure by year in the Republic of Korea. The measurements of all the components will allow us to identify the state of the air quality based on the given scales attached to these datasets. These datasets will provide us with a fundamental idea of how serious the issue of air pollution is affecting the population in the target region of Seoul and the whole country, which will be useful for our future exploratory data analysis and solution models.
The third dataset shows the number of deaths from air pollution in countries around the world between 1990 and 2017. This includes the total rate of deaths from air pollution, and the rate of each death per 100,000 people from indoor air pollution, outdoor particulate matter, and outdoor ozone pollution. We can find out how the trend of deaths changes by year, and which of the three causes has the greatest effect on death from air pollution. This dataset will explain how air pollution has a negative effect on people directly and will be the basis for data analysis and modeling performed to reduce air pollution.

## Project Plan

Based on the datasets we have collected, we are planning to perform exploratory data analysis in order to discover complimentary patterns and fully understand the current state of air quality considering various features. Next, we will perform a data cleaning approach as well as feature selection and feature engineering. With the patterns and relationships obtained from the EDA, we will then proceed with the design sketches of our approaches to cater to this problem. Our initial idea for tackling this issue is to create an automated filter model which has the ability to measure the level of air pollutants as the result of inputting the contaminants into personal homes which will then activate a filtration system. This device will execute a prediction on the level of air pollution as well as the time needed for the filtration system to decrease the pollutants and foreign particles to be fully extracted out of homes. In line with the device, we also plan to generate a correlated mobile application that informs the proportion of components and the diseases that the highest components can cause. Users are also able to remotely control their air filtration device via this application. To design the algorithm for this model, we plan to incorporate the most suitable machine learning approaches we have learned in class such as classification, regression, random forest, boosting, and neural networks models in order to obtain a well-generalized model. Upon completion of our model, suitable evaluation metrics will be executed to explore and measure the effectiveness of our model.
